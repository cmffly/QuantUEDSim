This code package includes kinematical, bloch wave, and multislice codes to calculate electron diffraction patterns from flat or rippled single crystal foils for UED. Some key parameters accounted for here include: crystal structure, lattice temperature, sample topography. Libraries of diffraction patterns can be calculated and fit to experimental data to retrieve lattice temperture changes.
